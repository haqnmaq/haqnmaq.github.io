title: About Me
---
 My name is Ryan Branch. I'm an autodidact with a range of different skills. I have experience in electronics and PCB layout, various CAD tools, different additive manufacturing technologies, mechanical design, model making, some machining, and everything in between. I have researched various manufacturing technologies as well as some of their limitations to design with manufacturing in mind. I have a passion for solving complex problems and thinking of new uses for existing technologies. While I lack a conventional college degree, I feel that my approach of "learning by doing" has given me an advantage by learning a broader range skills, instead of focusing on one specific discipline. That does however make it harder for anyone who want's to know my abilities, which is why I have created this portfolio of some of my projects over the past 4 or 5 years. I have been tinkering, designing, and creating things for as long as I can remember, however I didn't start documenting my projects until more recently. This website serves as an example of some of my work.
