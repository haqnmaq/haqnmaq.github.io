This is my personal 3d printer that I built starting in 2013 and finishing in 2014. My username/handle is "haqnmaq" pronounced "hack n make", so "Haqbot" seemed fitting.

### Build

  A bit of backstory first. I built my first printer in 2010. It was a Makerbot Cupcake CNC which is usually considered the worlds first consumer 3d printer. It was very tedious to use, loud, slow, and not very accurate, but it allowed me to create things at a whole new level. 

  I originally started the designing and building of this 3d printer in 2013. Do to financial limitations it took me about 5 months to complete. I wanted to design a printer that was unique, robust, fast, accurate, while being astheticaly pleasing as well. To accomplish this I decided on some unique H-Bot style kinematics. This was a unique concept at the time and allowed for very fast movements of the hot end. I eventually did change this to use a Core X-Y setup. It has the same kinematics as an H-Bot, but the unique belt path eliminated the racking forces seen with an H-bot configuration.

  I started with the mechanical design. Using 8020 aluminum extrusion as well as 3d printed parts from my Cupcake CNC. The original version was all designed in Sketchup. It was neer really designed to create complex 3d models, but it was all that was available to me at the time. Newer upgrades have been designed in Fusion 360 and printed on the Haqbot itself. 

  Below is a photo of an early stage in the mechanical assembly. The X,Y, and Z axis hardware is installed at this point and ready for the motors and belt to be installed.

  This photo is after further assembly of the electronics and extruder. The LCD control panel is now mounted and ready for the rest of the electronics to be installed. The Makerbot Cupcake CNC can be seen in the back left.
